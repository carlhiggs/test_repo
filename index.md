## A test repository page

This web page associated with the [test repo](https://github.com/carlhiggs/test_repo) repository was created from the Pages menu in Settings.  By clicking to select a theme, a web page template was generated in Markdown.  Markdown is a basic text format which describes how headings and other page elements should be styled, using minimal text symbols.  Git pages then interprets this markdown text document according to the chosen theme, and updates to reflect any changes made to the template.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/carlhiggs/test_repo/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
